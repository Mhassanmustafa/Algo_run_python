# Algo_run_python
A python Application which takes Input form User and predicts whether the passenger will survive or not based upon the Kaggel legendary Titanic ML competition dataset.

### Main aim
The main aim of project is to investigate how machine learning algorithms in Scikit-Learn can be used to train and test various models for Titanic Disaster dataset as well as in-depth
understanding of Machine Learning (ML) concepts. The task is to write down the input/output, how training examples and hypothesis are represented using a well know Titanic disaster
dataset practically.


you can find the dataset from the link below:
